### 2. Unique features of the language

C# and Java are similar languages that are typed statically, strongly, and manifestly. Both are object-oriented, and designed with semi-interpretation or runtime just-in-time compilation, and both are curly brace languages, like C and C++.

### JAVA:
1) Java programs are compiled into platform-independent byte-codes.


### C#:
1) C# is not quite as platform-independent, but will run under Windows and Mac OS-X (but not Linux).
