## Procedural Programming
### Java:
* JAVA is an object-oriented language deals with objects. Objects contain both data (member variables) and code (methods). Each object belongs to a particular class, which is a blueprint describing the member variables and methods an object offers.
* Java loosely support procedural programming if we follow certain design patterns.
* Procedural programming can be mapped onto object-oriented programming, by using a single default object to interpret all procedure calls, contain all global variables, and mapping procedure calls to messages to this default object.

### C#:

* C# does not support procedural programming language. It is an object-oriented language that uses classes and objects like Java.
